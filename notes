# setup
We are using snowpack for this tutorial. It looks like I should switch to vite in the future. It is a bundler that allows us to use node modules easily

# notes
- hover over variables and functions to get type
type can be specified with <> or as

- if type any specify or create a type for it

- not every library has types or is written in typescripts
- try installing library with types (it could be a separate library)

- compiler will generate a dist/index.js which will be used in index.html
# css and html
- labels are super user friendly always add them
- grid is a good choice in this case because there is less code you just need to set up the columns and rows. 
first row is made up of headers, second is lists and active
1fr is the available space left
- font size calc for large titles only
- rem vs em
- add letter space to bold small font to increase readability
- locally scoped custom properties (--spacer) can be okay if they are only used in one spot
