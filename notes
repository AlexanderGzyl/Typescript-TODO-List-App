# setup
We are using snowpack for this tutorial. It looks like I should switch to vite in the future. It is a bundler that allows us to use node modules easily

# notes
- hover over variables and functions to get type
type can be specified with <> or as

- if type any specify or create a type for it

- not every library has types or is written in typescripts
- try installing library with types (it could be a separate library)
